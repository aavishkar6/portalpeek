# Logs of my development process

## Day 1 - Jan 22, Wednesday

  1. Defined the directory structure and seperated folders into different modules. I knew what schemas were but now I understand that they are. **Schemas** are predefined data models that define the type, structure, and validity of the data. Whether it is a API request or a response, we can define a schema to ensure data consistency, data validity, and data predictability across our code.
  2. I migrated the scraper from another repo to this repo. Cleaned it and refactored it a bit.
  
### To be completed

  Define schema for database integration and store the announcements in the database.
  Use a scheduler to perform this scraping task repeatedly.
  Get the backend up and running and make sure he endpoints work.
  Get the email service up and running with a simple Jinja Template
