Ideally, we\u2019d track symptoms and mechanisms with more fidelity, but real-world settings like homes and small clinics pose challenges. Brian will discuss the strengths and limitations of assessment tools, from self-report questionnaires to clinic-based neuroimaging, and how repeated sampling, large datasets, and machine learning can help. Brian will illustrate this with data from home-based Alzheimer\u2019s Disease studies and clinical trials. Early findings from international dementia screening studies will also be presented.",
